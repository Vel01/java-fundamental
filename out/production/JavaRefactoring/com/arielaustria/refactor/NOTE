        Suppose you take out a 30 year mortgage for $100,000 at 7% interest ,
        and want to know the monthly payments. To do that, you divide the interest
        rate by 12 to get (.07/12) = .00583; and multiply 30 x 12 = 360 to get the
        number of payments. Then the formula gives you:
        payment = [$100,000(1 + .00583)360 x .00583] / [(1 + .00583)360 - 1] = $665

        WHILE principal is not equal to 1000 OR less than or equal to 1000000
            PRINT Enter a number between 1,000 and 1,000,000 (inclusive)
        WHILE annual interest rate is not greater than 0 and not less than or equal to 30
            PRINT Enter a value greater than 0 and less than or equal to 30 (inclusive)
        WHILE period is not greater or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 30
            PRINT Enter a value between 1 and 30 (inclusive)
        IF inputs are valid
            calculate, and use those values to get the total mortgage
        END OF IF
        PRINT total mortgage

        Payment Schedule
        p = principal
        r = interest rate
        n = number of payments
        m = payment made

        m = p [((1 + r) ^ n) - ((1 + r) ^ m) / ((1 + r) ^ n) - 1)];

   remaining_payment = principal * ((Math.pow(1 + interestRate, number_of_payments) -
                    Math.pow(1 + interestRate, ++payment_made)) / (Math.pow(1 + interestRate, number_of_payments) - 1));
